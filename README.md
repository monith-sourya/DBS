# Fitness Club Database Management System
DBS Assignment

Domain Description
Fitness clubs typically house diverse health associated activities, such as a well-equipped gymnasium, Zumba and aerobics classes, a power yoga centre, and probably even a kickboxing training unit. And like any other well-functioning company, the fitness club must have an effective database of its employees and customers. Customers could be categorised based on the type of membership they avail (silver, gold, or platinum) or type of plan they resort to (pre-paid or post-paid). The fitness club also has a dedicated counter that dispenses fruit juices and protein shakes. Customers can avail this facility during their time in the fitness club only using a dedicated membership card, which might have some cash balance on it (based on the type of plan taken, i.e. post-paid or pre-paid). 

Functionality Supported
Basic functionalities supported by the fitness club’s database management system include:
1.	Updating member count
The database will be able add new customers into their members list, making note of the type of membership they avail and the charges associated with each type. Membership can be of types silver, gold, or platinum, with different facilities being offered with each in addition to what the membership is availed for (basic gym, Zumba, aerobics, power yoga, kickboxing, or any combination of these). Customers may choose between two payment mechanisms, namely post-paid or pre-paid. Pre-paid mechanism also employs the use of a membership card. This card can be topped with some amount and can be used to avail in-house facilities, such as fruit juices and protein shakes. 

2.	Discounts availed
Every customer avails a discount on the first month’s billing upon initiating membership. The fitness club also has a referral program. For every person any already existing customer refers the fitness club to, he (the already existing customer) becomes eligible for an additional discount for the next month’s billing.

3.	Billing Details
After every month, customers availing the post-paid mechanism are intimated with the amount due. A list of all such customers is generated and updated as they pay up. If customers fail to pay up within two days from the deadline, they are marked as blacklisted and are prohibited from entering the gym until an additional overdue fine is paid.   

4.	Customer card balance checks
Customers can check how much they spent for in-house facilities (if employing pre-paid payment mechanism) or how much is due for the current month’s billing.

5.	Employee details
The fitness club’s manager might need to access the employees’ list, and thus, the database provides with this functionality as well. The list shows existing employees and the departments of work they are associated with along with their attendance rates. Pays and cuts will be adjusted accordingly.
 
6.	Attendance factor
The fitness club’s monthly tariffs are subject to deviations based on demand. This demand is measured by the number of new customers trying to avail membership and the existing attendance rates. 

7.	Basic inventory check
The database also provides with a basic inventory check functionality. This list is inclusive of all the types of equipment, their count, and their condition (functioning, requires repair, needs to be replaced).

8.	Checking company capital, profits, and expenses
The fitness club’s managerial team must also be able to check the company’s capital, profits, and expenses. These are measured based on inventory expenditure, employee salaries, and income generated from customer memberships.

GUI and Purpose

2.	Manager Dashboard: This will contain the functionalities pertaining to checking employee details and company capital, profits, and expenses.
